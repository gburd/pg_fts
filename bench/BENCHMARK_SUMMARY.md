# pg_fts benchmark summary — methodology and results (as of v1.6.0, 2026-09-09)

Consolidated view of the current measurements. Every number here is traceable to a
run recorded under `bench/`; nothing is estimated. Where a figure was previously
published wrong, the correction is stated rather than quietly replaced.

---

## 1. Methodology

### Rig
EC2 **r6id.4xlarge** (Xeon 8375C @ 2.90 GHz, 16 vCPU, 128 GB RAM, 884 GB local
NVMe instance store), Amazon Linux 2023, PostgreSQL **17.10** built from source,
`shared_buffers = 64GB`. **One dedicated instance per engine** for comparative
runs — no engine shares a host with another.

Benchmarks run on **local NVMe, never tmpfs**, so I/O behaviour is real.

### Corpus
2,188,038 Wikipedia articles, pre-joined to exactly **two columns**
(`id bigint`, `content text`, where content = title + ' ' + body). Every engine
loads the identical file and indexes **`content` and nothing else**. Row count is
verified on every host before measuring.

This "identical single column" discipline exists because an earlier run compared
engines on *different* column sets and produced a false apples-to-apples claim
(§7).

### Timing protocol
**8 runs per query, median of the last 5.** The first 1–3 runs are discarded as
warm-up.

This is not arbitrary. An earlier protocol dropped only one cold run, which was
insufficient for two engines: pg_search reported 6.86 ms for a query whose steady
state is **2.13 ms** — a 3× error, in the direction that flattered pg_fts. The
8-run rule was adopted after that, and every arm is now re-measured by hand rather
than trusted from a subagent's summary.

### Correctness gate
`bench/parity_check.sh` compares index-returned top-k against an exact `fts_bm25`
sort over the heap, for five query shapes (single-term, AND, OR) at k=10 and
k=100. **A benchmark result is not reported unless parity passes.** This has caught
real bugs mid-optimisation, including a page-directory cursor that looked 2× faster
while returning garbage.

Match counts are cross-checked against **regex ground truth** on the raw text
(`\myear\M` etc.), not merely against the other engines.

### Profiling
`perf record -F 1999 -g` attached to the backend running a tight query loop, then
`perf report --no-children`. Where cost attribution mattered, it was confirmed with
**explicit counters compiled into the extension**, not inferred from the profile
alone.

## 2. Comparative latency — 4 engines, identical corpus

Median ms, warm. pg_fts figures are **v1.6.0**; the three competitors were measured
in the 5-way run (`bench/RESULTS_5WAY_159b_2026-09-06.md`) and are unchanged since,
as neither 1.5.10 nor 1.6.0 touched their hosts.

| query | **pg_fts 1.6.0** | pg_textsearch | pg_search | vchord |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rare k10 (`slovakia`, df 10,875) | **5.89** | 7.36 | 2.13 | 2.48 |
| mid k10 (`hungary`, df 24,097) | 10.64 | **7.96** | 2.04 | 2.40 |
| common k10 (`year`, df 734,896) | 36.16 | 20.71 | **2.12** | 3.49 |
| common k100 | 46.01 | 50.71 | **3.72** | 24.52 |
| exact `count(*)` common | **2.20** | N/A | 13.63 | N/A |
| AND 2-term | 4.38 | N/A | **3.17** | N/A |
| OR 2-term | 4.12 | N/A | 3.35 | N/A |
| OR 3-term | 6.80 | N/A | **4.35** | N/A |
| prefix | 5.27 | N/A | **2.05** | N/A |
| phrase (`positions=on`) | 229 | N/A | **22.9** | N/A |

Common k10/k100 improved 1.56×/1.52× in 1.5.10; rare, mid and OR were flat. 1.6.0
is correctness-only and changed no latency.

### Index size and build

| | **pg_fts** | pg_textsearch | pg_search | vchord |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| index size | **1,421 MB** | 1,887 MB | 2,734 MB | 2,902 MB |
| build time | 381 s | 496 s | **127 s** | **56 s** |

pg_fts has the **smallest index in the field** — 25% under the next best, 2.0×
smaller than vchord. It is also the slowest to build of the three that stem.

### Match-count agreement (the fairness check)

| term | pg_fts | vchord | pg_textsearch | pg_search |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| slovakia | 10,875 | 10,875 | 10,875 | 10,853 |
| hungary | 24,097 | 24,097 | 24,097 | 23,990 |
| **year** | **734,896** | **734,896** | **734,896** | **495,580** |

**Three of four engines agree byte-for-byte.** pg_search is 33% low on `year`
because **Tantivy does not stem**; regex ground truth confirms `\myears?\M` =
733,960, i.e. ours is the correct English set. So pg_fts scans ~48% more postings
than pg_search on that query *and* returns the right answer — worth holding in mind
when reading the common-term row.

## 3. Where the time goes — profile of the shipped build

`perf` on v1.6.0 (`bench/RESULTS_GATING_2026-09-09.md`):

| band | doclen (`load_page` + `lookup`) | `topk_candidates_range` | `wand_load_block` |
|---|---|---|---|
| rare | **68.9%** (64.4 + 4.5) | 6.8% | — |
| mid | **71.6%** (65.8 + 5.8) | 6.0% | — |
| common | **45.2%** (28.3 + 16.9) | 37.2% | 6.4% |

**The doclen sidecar path dominates every band.** This corrected a split previously
quoted ("39% candidates / 43% doclen") that had never been captured from a real run
on the shipped build.

What remains in `load_page` is the **gap-decode prefix**: sidecar docids are
delta-encoded, so reaching an arbitrary offset means walking from entry 0 —
measured at **60–82 entries per probe**. That is a property of the format, not an
inefficiency, which is why the cheaper fixes were tried and rejected (§6).

Ceiling if a format change allowed a mid-block start (halving the prefix): rare
5.89 → ~3.99 ms, mid 10.64 → ~7.14 ms ≈ **1.5×** on the two bands the field
actually queries.

---

## 4. Phrase queries — a 36× configuration cliff

`bench/NOTE_PHRASE_PROFILE_2026-09-06.md`. `WITH (positions = on)` defaults to
**off**; without it a phrase cannot be verified from the index and the scan falls
back to AND + a heap recheck of every candidate.

| query | `positions=off` (default) | `positions=on` | speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| ranked top-10 `"united states"` (361,465 matches) | **8,385 ms** | **229 ms** | **36.6×** |
| ranked `"new york"` | 4,853 ms | 129 ms | 37.7× |
| ranked `"world war"` | 4,347 ms | 119 ms | 36.5× |
| exact phrase `count(*)` | 7,170 ms | **132 ms** | **54.3×** |
| index size | 1,421 MB | 2,626 MB (1.85×) | — |

Profiling the tuned path shows the adjacency test itself is only **4.3%** of the
query; 21% is materialising the full match set before ranking. A lazy phrase gate
was designed and **declined**: ceiling ~1.5× (229 → ~150 ms), which does not close
the gap to pg_search's 22.9 ms, in exchange for changes to a hot scan path that has
already produced three crash-fix releases.

Note also that phrase syntax needs **double** quotes; single quotes yield a plain
conjunction. That mistake produced a wrong published number (§7).

## 5. Build and maintenance measurements

### `maintenance_work_mem` decides whether you pay for a merge at all
(`bench/RESULTS_GATING_2026-09-09.md`)

| `maintenance_work_mem` | build | segments after build | follow-up merge | final index |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 64MB (PostgreSQL default) | 475 s | 8 | 216 s | 8,613 MB |
| 256MB | 367 s | 6 | 223 s | 5,793 MB |
| **1GB** | 523 s | **1** | **none needed** | 4,605 MB |
| **2GB** | 527 s | **1** | **none needed** | 4,323 MB |

At ≥1GB this corpus builds straight to one segment and the merge disappears. At the
64MB default it needs 8 segments plus a 216 s merge and lands **twice as large**.

### Parallel merge is a regression
(`bench/RESULTS_PARALLEL_MERGE_2026-09-08.md`)

| configuration | merge time | resulting index |
|---|---|---|
| serial (2 runs) | **230.6 s** | 8,606 MB |
| parallel W=3 / W=1 (3 runs) | **333.5 s** | 10,229 MB |

**1.45× slower and 19% larger**, with W=1 costing the same as W=3 — a fixed penalty
for taking the path, not a scaling curve. Correctness unaffected (all runs converged
to one segment with identical match counts).

A trap found while measuring: at `max_parallel_maintenance_workers = 8` the workers
register, start and **exit within ~2 ms**, so the merge silently runs *serially* —
confirmed with postmaster `DEBUG1`. Those runs looked fast because they were the
serial path.

### Parallel build: faster but larger

| `mwm` | serial | 4 workers |
|---|---|---|
| 256MB | 367 s / 4,373 MB | 308 s / **5,466 MB** |
| 1GB | 523 s / 4,605 MB | 464 s / **5,386 MB** |
| 2GB | 527 s / 4,323 MB | 360 s / 4,328 MB |

The same per-worker output fragmentation as the merge regression — one defect
surfacing in two places. Under investigation as ROADMAP 3a.

### Sparsemap tombstone filter (partial)
At zero tombstone density, three separately compiled arms (stock / batched
`sm_contains_many` / resume cursor) merge in 231.6 / 233.7 / 233.2 s with a
**byte-identical** output index — 0.9% spread, so the batched filter is not a
regression. **The delete-heavy half is unmeasured**: the rig's suppression control
turned out not to exist in our source.
`bench/RESULTS_SPARSEMAP_2026-09-08.md`.

## 6. Hypotheses tested and rejected

Recorded so they are not retried. Each was disproven by measurement, not opinion.

| idea | why rejected |
|---|---|
| Precomputed per-block max score | Measured true block max **equals** the existing `impact(max_tf, min_dl)` bound to 4 decimals — gains nothing |
| Finer (16-posting) block granularity | Lowers the max only 3.7–4.6%, still above threshold |
| Tune k to improve pruning | Pruning identical at k=1/10/100 |
| df-threshold bulk doclen load | Cost is ~linear in df with **no fixed floor**; the smallest term is already at the plain `@@@` floor |
| Lazy/partial per-entry block decode | Made rare **worse** (5.83 → 7.74 ms). `bm25_for_get` was bit-at-a-time, and the "71× amplification" that motivated it was an arithmetic artifact of ours — the sidecar is keyed by *all* docids, so ~64–82 entries per probe are unavoidable prefix, not waste |
| LRU of decoded doclen blocks | WAND ascends monotonically, so a cursor never revisits a block. Reframed into the per-segment sharing that shipped in 1.5.9 (1.4–1.6× on multi-term) |
| Parallel ranked scan | Built, verified byte-exact, **reverted**: ~30% Amdahl ceiling and workers refused to launch inside `ExecCustomScan`. Re-analysed post-1.5.10: best case ~8.3 ms vs pg_search 2.12 |
| Impact-ordered postings | Breaks the docid ordering `count(*)`/AND/phrase/prefix depend on; implies a second posting layout, spending our size lead |
| Heap-side `positions=off` | Saves exactly `4 × doclen` (~16% of a short doc), and `ftsdoc` is `STORAGE = extended`, so the real delta is the compressed one |
| Lazy phrase gate | Ceiling ~1.5×; the adjacency test is only 4.3% of the query |

## 7. Published corrections

Kept because the corrections are part of the result.

1. **Indexed columns were not uniform** in an early 5-way. Corrected, then re-run on
   an identical single column.
2. **"pg_fts scans 48% more postings"** was first attributed to that column
   mismatch; the identical-column run disproved it and found the real cause
   (Tantivy not stemming).
3. **Phrase "90.70 ms" was not a phrase** — written with single quotes, it parsed to
   a plain conjunction. Real numbers in §4.
4. **pg_search's medians were 3× too slow** in one run (insufficient warm-up),
   flattering pg_fts. Fixed by the 8-run protocol.
5. **"39% candidates / 43% doclen"** was never measured on the shipped build; the
   real split is §3.
6. **"rare/mid at their floor"** understated the remaining opportunity — reasoned
   from the common profile where `load_page` is 28%, not the ~65% it is on rare/mid.

---

## 8. Honest summary

**Strengths.** Smallest index in the field (1,421 MB, 25% under next best). Fastest
exact `count(*)` (2.20 ms — 6× pg_search, the only other engine that offers it).
Rare-term ranked beats the like-for-like comparator (5.89 vs 7.36 ms). Correct
English stemming, verified against regex ground truth. Widest query language by a
large margin (see `CAPABILITIES.md` and the feature matrix).

**Weaknesses.** Common-term ranked top-k (36.16 ms vs pg_search 2.12) — the largest
remaining gap, now understood as doclen gap-decode and addressable only by a sidecar
format change worth ~1.5×. Phrase needs a non-default option to be usable at scale,
and even tuned is ~10× off pg_search. Parallel merge is a regression; parallel build
trades size for speed. Big-endian is untested in CI (sparsemap 5.5.0 fixed a
corruption that reached our tombstone iteration).

**Comparator note.** `pg_textsearch` is the fairest reference point — same
PostgreSQL `english` config, byte-identical match counts, same C-extension model.
Against it pg_fts is faster on rare, slower on mid, 1.7× slower on common k10, 1.1×
faster on common k100, 25% smaller, and adds count/AND/OR/phrase/prefix/fuzzy/regex
it does not have. The larger deficits are against the two engines shipping their own
posting formats — one of which does not stem.
